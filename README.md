# wfm-face-timepunch

WFM Face TimePunch gives store partners the ability to log punches by scanning their face.
Microsoft Azure Face API is used to persist partners facial identifications.
Azure's internal algorithms are used to compare newly captured images with the faces already on file.

1. Register a new Partner.
2. Login to be identified.
3a. On success, you will be able to punch against your time card.
3b. On failure, you will be prompted to register again.

This is a Proof-Of-Concept application.
